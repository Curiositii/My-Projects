Welcome to my coding playground! This repo is a collection of my personal and academic projects â€” each one showing my growth as a developer and my interest in building practical, back-endâ€“focused software. From small experiments to full applications, this space highlights how I approach solving real problems with clean, logical code.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Java & Spring Projects â€“ Back-end applications that focus on logic, structure, and data handling.

C++ Practice Programs â€“ Projects focused on object-oriented design, parsing, and algorithm work.

Web Experiments â€“ Basic HTML, CSS, and JS pages Iâ€™ve customized and built to learn front-end concepts.

Learning Projects â€“ Coursework or side projects where I explore APIs, databases, and system design.

ðŸŽ¯ My Focus

Iâ€™m mainly working toward becoming a back-end software developer, so most of my projects focus on building solid logic, clean architecture, and working with data efficiently. I like to understand how things work under the hood â€” whether thatâ€™s through debugging, data flow analysis, or system integration.

ðŸš€ How to Explore

Each project lives in its own folder with its own README explaining what it does and how to run it. Feel free to dig around, try things out, or just get a feel for how I code.
